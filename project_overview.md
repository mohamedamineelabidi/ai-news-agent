AI News Recommendation Agent Project Details
Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered news recommendation agent that tailors news content to individual user preferences. The agent will interact with an existing platform via API calls, receive user preferences, fetch and analyze news articles, generate personalized recommendations, and return formatted responses to the platform.
Key Components & Workflow
1. Project Setup
Directory Structure: Create organized folders for API, analysis, configuration, documentation, fetchers, recommendations, responses, tests, and utilities.
Git Repository: Initialize for version control.
Virtual Environment: Set up using venv or conda.
Requirements File: Include FastAPI, spaCy, OpenAI, requests, Pydantic, and uvicorn.
README.md: Provide project overview, setup instructions, API documentation, and usage examples.
Configuration & Environment Variables: Store API keys and settings in .env and config.py.
.gitignore: Exclude sensitive files and directories.
2. API Gateway
FastAPI Application: Structure with main app file and router.
Endpoints:
POST /api/preferences: Receive user preferences as JSON.
GET /api/recommendations: Send article recommendations.
Request/Response Models: Use Pydantic for data validation.
Error Handling & Logging: Implement middleware for error responses and logging.
Authentication & Rate Limiting: Use API keys or JWT for authentication and limit request rates.
3. User Preference Processing
Preference Parsing: Convert incoming JSON data into structured preferences.
Validation: Ensure preferences meet specified criteria.
Transformation: Convert preferences into query parameters for news fetching.
Weighting System: Assign weights to different preference types.
Unit Tests: Validate preference processing functions.
4. News Fetching
NewsAPI Integration: Construct queries based on user preferences and fetch articles.
Error Handling: Manage API errors and pagination.
Caching: Cache results to avoid redundant API calls.
Fallback Mechanisms: Provide alternatives if NewsAPI is unavailable.
Unit Tests: Test news fetching logic.
5. News Analysis (LLM-Based)
OpenAI Integration: Use LLM for keyword extraction, summarization, sentiment analysis, and topic categorization.
Caching & Error Handling: Optimize LLM calls and handle API issues.
Unit Tests: Validate LLM-based analysis functions.
6. Recommendation Engine
Content-Based Filtering: Develop algorithm to match articles with user preferences.
Scoring & Ranking: Implement scoring system and diversity measures.
Recency Bias: Prioritize newer articles.
Personalization: Adjust recommendations based on user history if available.
Unit Tests: Test recommendation logic.
7. Response Formatting
Structured Responses: Format article data with LLM-derived insights.
Relevance Scores: Include in responses.
Error Formats: Standardize error messages.
Unit Tests: Validate formatting functions.
8. Integration & Testing
End-to-End Pipeline: Connect all modules.
Test Fixtures: Create sample user preferences and articles.
Integration & Performance Tests: Ensure system reliability and efficiency.
9. Deployment Preparation
Dockerization: Create Dockerfile and Docker Compose.
Serverless Deployment: Configure for AWS Lambda or GCP Functions.
Health Checks: Implement endpoints for monitoring.
Environment Management: Handle variables for different environments.
10. Documentation & Finalization
API Documentation: Use OpenAPI/Swagger.
System Architecture: Document components and workflow.
Inline Comments: Explain key functions.
Guides: Create troubleshooting and integration guides.
README Finalization: Include setup and usage instructions.
