AI News Recommendation Agent Implementation Todo List
### Phase 9
Phase 1: Project Setup
[ ] Create project directory structure
[ ] Initialize Git repository
[ ] Set up Python virtual environment
[ ] Create requirements.txt (add openai library)
[ ] Write basic README.md
[ ] Configure environment variables (OpenAI API key, NewsAPI key)
[ ] Create .gitignore (exclude .env, __pycache__, etc.)


Phase 2: API Gateway Implementation
[ ] Set up FastAPI app structure
[ ] Implement API endpoints:
POST /api/preferences (receive user preferences)
GET /api/recommendations (send article recommendations)
[ ] Define Pydantic models for request/response validation
[ ] Add error handling and logging
[ ] Implement authentication (API key/JWT)
[ ] Set up rate limiting


Phase 3: User Preference Processing
[ ] Create preference processing module
[ ] Parse and validate preference JSON data
[ ] Convert preferences to query parameters
[ ] Support topics, keywords, sources, and language preferences
[ ] Implement weighting for different preference types
[ ] Write unit tests for preference processing


Phase 4: News Fetching
[ ] Build NewsAPI client module
[ ] Construct API queries based on user preferences
[ ] Handle NewsAPI errors and pagination
[ ] Implement caching to avoid redundant calls
[ ] Add fallback mechanisms for API outages
[ ] Write unit tests for news fetching


Phase 5: News Analysis (LLM-Based)
[ ] Install OpenAI Python library
[ ] Configure OpenAI API key in environment variables
[ ] Implement LLM-based functions:
Extract keywords from articles
Generate text summaries
Analyze sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)
Categorize articles into topics (tech, health, etc.)
[ ] Optimize LLM calls with caching
[ ] Handle OpenAI API rate limits/errors
[ ] Write unit tests for LLM functions


Phase 6: Recommendation Engine
[ ] Create recommendation module
[ ] Implement content-based filtering algorithm
[ ] Develop scoring and ranking mechanisms
[ ] Add diversity and recency bias to recommendations
[ ] Write unit tests for recommendation logic


Phase 7: Response Formatting
[ ] Build response formatting module
[ ] Structure article data with LLM-derived insights
Include keywords, summaries, sentiment, and categories
[ ] Add relevance scores to responses
[ ] Create standardized error formats
[ ] Write unit tests for formatting functions


Phase 8: Integration & Testing
[ ] Connect all modules in the main pipeline
[ ] Perform end-to-end testing
[ ] Create test fixtures with sample data
[ ] Test NewsAPI and OpenAI integrations
[ ] Conduct performance/load testing


Phase 9: Deployment Preparation
[ ] Create Dockerfile for containerization
[ ] Set up Docker Compose for local development
[ ] Prepare serverless deployment configs (AWS Lambda/GCP Functions)
[ ] Implement health check endpoints
[ ] Configure environment variables for production


Phase 10: Documentation & Final Touches
[ ] Document API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger
[ ] Write system architecture and component docs
[ ] Add inline code comments
[ ] Create troubleshooting and integration guides
[ ] Finalize README with setup instructions


Bonus Tasks (Time Permitting)
[ ] Implement user feedback loop for recommendations
[ ] Add A/B testing for recommendation algorithms
[ ] Build admin dashboard for monitoring
[ ] Implement preference learning over time
